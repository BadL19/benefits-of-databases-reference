## Practice Questions – Benefits of Databases

1. How does a database system enable data sharing among users?

Database users can access data depending on their roles in an organization.

2. Explain how databases reduce data inconsistency.

A database prevents multiple copies of the same data. Data is stored at a single location and could be accessed ny multiple users at once. 


3. Define data integrity.

The database helps to maintain the consistency in data by preventing duplication.

4. Provide an example of privacy control in a university database.

Database users have different roles defined so that users who access data don’t view data outside of their roles. 
For example, a professor who has access to student’s name registered in his or her course should not be able to view the names if students registered in different courses.

5. How does a DBMS ensure data security?

Depending on organizational needs, different security levels could be defined within the database. 
Users who access a database have their identity authenticated using username and password.

6. Why are backup and recovery important in database systems?

Depending on DBMS settings, backups for a database could be created automatically or 
manually which would help restore the database resulting from a system crash.
