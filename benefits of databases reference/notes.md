## Benefits of Databases

### 1. Sharing of Data
- Multiple users can access data simultaneously.
- Access is role-based; users only see data they are authorized to view.
- Shared data is instantly available across the organization.

### 2. Reducing Data Inconsistency
- A single source of truth; no duplicate copies.
- Changes by one user are instantly visible to others with permission.

### 3. Data Integrity
- Prevents data duplication.
- Ensures consistency and accuracy across the system.

### 4. Privacy
- Role-based access limits data visibility.
- Example: A professor can only view students in their own courses.

### 5. Data Security
- Security levels can be defined as needed.
- Authentication via username and password.

### 6. Backup and Recovery
- Databases can have automatic or manual backups.
- Allows restoration after system crashes or data loss.
